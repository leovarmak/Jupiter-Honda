Back-end data mining will segregate the information to UIDAI (Unique Identity Authority of India) and those not registered will have it in Cloud based vaults. The former now gets the information to store against the person’s records. (In our last filed Patent the UIDAI collaborated).Those who need immediate attention are now put on a call to the Specialists in a city location on the Tablet. Wherever the mobile signal doesn’t allow for this, a recording is made of the patient complaints, shared later in signal positive areas and the findings and the diagnosis communicated physically by the Paramedic rider.<br>
